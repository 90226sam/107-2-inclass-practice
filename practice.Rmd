This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
`a` <- 2
3 -> `b`
`a`+`b`->`x`
```

```{r}
`x`*100
```

```{r}
`107grades`<-90 
```

```{r}
`a`<-50
`a2`<-50L
```

`avector`<-(10,30,50)
`a2vector<-(10,30,50)
```{r}
`avector`<-c(10,20,30)
`a2vector`<-c(10,20,30)
```
